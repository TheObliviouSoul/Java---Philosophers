**Tasks:**
1. **Philosopher Class:**
   - Complete the methods `eat()`, `think()`, `talk()`, and `run()` in the Philosopher class.

2. **Monitor Class:**
   - Implement methods `pickUp()`, `putDown()`, `requestTalk()`, and `endTalk()` using Java synchronization primitives (`wait()` and `notifyAll()`). Ensure the solution is deadlock- and starvation-free.

3. **Variable Number of Philosophers:**
   - Modify the program to accept a positive integer (â‰¥3) from input to set the number of philosophers. Handle invalid inputs gracefully.

4. **Dynamic Modification of Number of Philosophers:**
   - Determine and implement (if feasible) changes to allow philosophers to join or leave the table during execution. If not feasible, provide a clear explanation.

5. **Additional Condition:**
   - Add mutual exclusion for two pepper shakers shared by eating philosophers.
